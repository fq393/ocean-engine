/**
 * thunder.js — turning a channel into a sound.
 *
 * Thunder is not an explosion at a point. Every metre of channel is its
 * own source: the return stroke deposits of order 10^4 joules per metre in
 * a few microseconds, the air cannot get out of the way, and a cylindrical
 * shock wave expands from the whole length of the bolt at once. That shock
 * runs out to a "relaxation radius" of a few metres, where it has spent
 * its overpressure, and from there travels as an ordinary sound wave —
 * an N-wave, a sharp compression followed by a rarefaction, a few
 * milliseconds long, which is why the acoustic spectrum of thunder peaks
 * near 50-100 Hz.
 *
 * The consequence is that thunder's *shape* is the channel's geometry
 * projected onto the listener by the speed of sound. Sound from the
 * nearest point arrives first; sound from the far end of a five-kilometre
 * channel arrives up to fifteen seconds later. The crack is the part of
 * the channel that is close and nearly equidistant; the rumble is
 * everything else, arriving in the order the geometry dictates.
 *
 * So this module does not synthesise thunder with noise and filters. It
 * builds a genuine acoustic impulse response by summing, for every segment
 * of the simulated channel, an N-wave delayed by its travel time, scaled
 * by 1/r, and low-passed by the frequency-dependent absorption of that
 * much air. Convolve any short source with it and you get the thunder that
 * *this* flash would actually make, from *this* listening position.
