 * channel.js — the discharge tree.
 *
 * A flash is a graph, not a polyline. Every node except a root has one
 * parent, so the structure is a forest: typically two trees sharing an
 * initiation point, one grown by the negative end of the bidirectional
 * leader and one by the positive end. Segments are (parent -> node)
 * pairs, which makes the whole thing renderable as a flat instanced
 * buffer and traversable in creation order without recursion.
 *
 * Per-node state carries the physics the renderer and the acoustics both
 * need: deposited charge, arc length from the root, distance from the
 * eventual attachment point (which sets when the return-stroke front
 * arrives), instantaneous current, channel temperature and luminosity.
