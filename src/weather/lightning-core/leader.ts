/**
 * leader.js - stepped-leader propagation by the Dielectric Breakdown Model.
 *
 * Niemeyer, Pietronero and Wiesmann (1984) proposed that a branched
 * discharge can be grown one bond at a time from a stochastic rule whose
 * only input is the local electric field:
 *
 *     p_i  =  (E_i - E_c)^eta / sum_j (E_j - E_c)^eta      for E_i > E_c
 *
 * eta selects the morphology, and with it the fractal dimension:
 * eta = 0 gives a space-filling Eden cluster, eta = 1 reproduces
 * diffusion-limited aggregation, and large eta collapses the structure
 * to a single filament. Photographed lightning channels sit around
 * D = 1.1-1.4 in projection, which this model reaches for eta ~ 1.5-3.
 *
 * Three deliberate departures from the 1984 lattice formulation, each of
 * which makes the result more like real lightning rather than less:
 *
 *  - Candidates are drawn from a Fibonacci sphere rather than the 26
 *    neighbours of a cubic lattice. A lattice imprints its own axes on
 *    the channel; a real leader has no preferred direction, and a
 *    quasi-uniform direction set removes the artefact without changing
 *    the statistics of the rule.
 *
 *  - Every active tip advances once per round rather than one bond being
 *    chosen globally per iteration. Branches on a real leader grow
 *    simultaneously, and rounds give the simulation an honest clock:
 *    one round is one step, taking step_length / v_leader seconds.
 *
 *  - The threshold E_c is the density-scaled *leader* propagation field
 *    (~200 kV/m x delta for a negative leader, ~125 for a positive one),
 *    not the microscopic streamer or breakdown field. At a resolution of
 *    tens of metres the enormous field enhancement at the tip is
 *    unresolved, and this is the standard effective threshold used by
 *    3-D fractal lightning models.
 *
 * The asymmetry between the two thresholds is the reason positive
 * leaders are so much smoother and less branched than negative ones, and
 * therefore why a positive cloud-to-ground flash looks like a single
 * clean stroke while a negative one looks like a root system.
