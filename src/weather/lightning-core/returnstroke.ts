/**
 * returnstroke.js — the bright part.
 *
 * The moment the descending leader touches something grounded, the whole
 * channel is shorted to earth. A neutralisation wave runs back up it at
 * roughly a third of the speed of light, and the several coulombs the
 * leader spent thirty milliseconds carefully distributing along fifteen
 * kilometres of air are drained in under a hundred microseconds. That
 * ratio — tens of milliseconds to charge, tens of microseconds to
 * discharge — is the whole reason lightning is violent.
 *
 * The model here is the MTLE (modified transmission line, exponential),
 * the engineering standard: the base current waveform, delayed by the
 * front's travel time to each point and attenuated as exp(-z/lambda) with
 * lambda ~ 2 km. It is the model that reproduces measured remote electric
 * and magnetic fields, so it also gets the *distribution* of light along
 * the channel right, which is what a viewer actually sees.
